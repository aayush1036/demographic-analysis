# Demographic Analysis 

This is a R file aiming to analyse the correlation between the internet users in a country, birth rate of the country, income group of the country and the region of the country.

There are several plots in the code which are explained below 

## Section A 
a1) Depicting the income group and the number of countries having that particular percentage of internet users 

a2) This plot depicts the income group of a country against the birth rate in that particular country with the dot size of 3

a3) This plot depicts the income group of a country against the birth rate in that particular country with the dot size of 3 and the color of the dots is set to blue 

a4) This plot depicts the boxplot of the income group of a country against the birth rate in that particular country.

## Section B
b1) This plot depicts the percentage of internet users in a country against the birth rate of a particular country. 

b2) This plot depicts the percentage of internet users in a country against the birth rate of a particular country with the dot size of 3 and the color of the dots set to red. 

b3) This plot depicts the percentage of internet users in a country against the birth rate of a particular country with the dot size of 3 and the color of the dots set accordingly with the income group of that country which means that different income groups will correspond to different colors. 

### Before proceeding to section C we have merged our existing dataframe with additional columns which have data about the region of the world in which the country is located and the new dataframe is called as “merged”

## Section C 
c1) This plot depicts the percentage of internet users in a country against the birth rate in that particular country with the size of the dots set to 3 and the dots corresponding to a particular country are colored according to the region of the world that country is in. 

c2) This plot depicts the percentage of internet users in a country against the birth rate in that particular country with the size of the hollow diamonds set to 3 and the hollow diamonds corresponding to a particular country are colored according to the region of the world that country is in. The shape is set to 23 in this plot which means that the dots representing a particular country are now transformed into hollow diamonds.

c3) This plot depicts the percentage of internet users in a country against the birth rate in that particular country with the size of the dots set to 3 and the dots corresponding to a particular country are colored according to the region of the world the particular country belongs to. The transparency of the dots is set to 0.6 where 0 corresponds to completely transparent and 1 corresponds to completely opaque. The shape is set to 19 which corresponds to a dot 

c4) This plot depicts the percentage of internet users in a country against the birth rate in that particular country with the size of the dots set to 3 and the dots corresponding to a particular country are colored according to the region of the world the particular country belongs to. The transparency of the dots is set to 0.6 where 0 corresponds to completely transparent and 1 corresponds to completely opaque and the title of “Birth Rate v/s Internet Users” is given to the plot via the main attribute.
